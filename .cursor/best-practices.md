# Best Practices

This document outlines best practices to follow when developing the Water Pour Fun project.

## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Extract repeated logic into reusable functions or components
- Create utility functions for common operations
- Use custom hooks to share stateful logic between components
- Implement higher-order components or render props for cross-cutting concerns
- Define types and interfaces in shared locations
- Use constants for repeated values

## Composability

- Design components with a single responsibility
- Keep components small and focused
- Use composition over inheritance
- Pass children as props when appropriate
- Leverage React's component composition model
- Consider using React Context for deeply nested component trees

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Use classes for game objects and scenes
- Encapsulate state and behavior
- Define clear interfaces for class interaction
- Use inheritance for specialized game elements
- Follow SOLID principles:
  - Single Responsibility Principle
  - Open/Closed Principle
  - Liskov Substitution Principle
  - Interface Segregation Principle
  - Dependency Inversion Principle

## Type Safety

- Use TypeScript's type system effectively
- Define interfaces and types for data structures
- Avoid using `any` type whenever possible
- Use union types for variables that can have multiple types
- Leverage generics for reusable components and functions
- Use type guards for runtime type checking

## Performance

- Implement React.memo for pure functional components
- Use useCallback for event handlers passed as props
- Leverage useMemo for expensive calculations
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Use virtualization for long lists
- Optimize assets (images, fonts, etc.)
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading

## Code Quality

- Write unit tests for critical functionality
- Use ESLint to catch common issues
- Follow the style guide consistently
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments to explain complex logic
- Review your own code before committing

## Error Handling

- Implement error boundaries for UI components
- Provide fallback UI for error states
- Log errors appropriately
- Handle promise rejections with try/catch or .catch()
- Validate user input
- Provide meaningful error messages

## Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include alt text for images
- Ensure proper keyboard navigation
- Maintain appropriate color contrast
- Test with screen readers
- Follow WCAG guidelines

## State Management

- Keep state as close as possible to where it's used
- Avoid unnecessary global state
- Use React Context for state that needs to be accessed by many components
- Consider using a state management library only for complex state
- Use immutable state updates
- Separate UI state from application state

## Security

- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize data displayed to users
- Use HTTPS for all network requests
- Keep dependencies updated
- Follow security best practices for authentication (if implemented)
- Be cautious with third-party libraries

## Game Development Specific

- Use Phaser's built-in physics engine appropriately
- Optimize game loop for performance
- Use asset preloading
- Implement efficient collision detection
- Separate game logic from rendering
- Consider device capabilities and limitations
